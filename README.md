# Ecommerce Transaction Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project simulates a real-world **Ecommerce Transaction System** using **PostgreSQL**. It consists of a **2000+ rows dataset** representing customer transactions, including order details, payment methods, and product categories. The project demonstrates advanced SQL techniques to analyze and extract meaningful insights from large transactional data.

## Features & Insights
- Designed a normalized relational database schema to handle ecommerce transaction data.
- Generated **2000+ rows** of realistic dummy data representing:
  - Customer information
  - Product details
  - Order transactions
  - Payment methods
  - Shipping & delivery status
- Used complex SQL queries to extract insights such as:
  - **Top-selling products** and categories
  - **Revenue trends** by month
  - **Customer behavior analysis** (e.g., repeat customers, cart abandonment)
  - **Payment method performance**
- Utilized PostgreSQL features like **CTEs**, **Window Functions**, **JOINS**, and **Aggregates** to get advanced analytics.

## Tools & Technologies
- **PostgreSQL**: Database management system for creating and managing data.
- **SQL**: Writing complex queries to analyze the data.
- **CSV**: Dataset for ecommerce transactions.
- **Excel**: For generating CSV dataset (optional step).
